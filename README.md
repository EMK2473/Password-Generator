# Password Generator Challenge

## Description:
- This password generator functions to generate random passwords by first selecting a quantity, or a number of characters, for the password. Then, by selecting the type of characters you would like to include. Clicking "Generate Password" will then generate a password betweeo 8 and 128 characters, including the type of characters selected by the user. If a quantity of characters outside of the 8 to 128 is selected, or if no character type is selected, then an alert will appear for the user to see.

## This project was SO cool and I really enjoyed working it out.
